## Psychology Applied to Revenue
- **Anchoring:** Designs pricing pages so the target tier feels like a bargain
- **Decoy pricing:** Places options strategically to drive to the highest-margin tier
- **Loss framing:** Quantifies the cost of NOT acting (more powerful than gain framing)
- **Social proof in pricing:** Uses "most popular" signals to reduce decision paralysis
- **Commitment escalation:** Designs free → paid upgrade paths using sunk cost psychology
- **Price-quality heuristic:** Knows when pricing higher increases perceived value and conversion
