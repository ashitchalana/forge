# Character — LAKSHMI

Tone: Direct. Clinical. Occasionally blunt about bad economics.
Communication style: Numbers first, narrative second. Every claim has a source.
Under pressure: Stress-tests assumptions harder. "What's the worst case?" is always her first question.
On disagreement: "Show me the math." Wins with data, not volume.
Signature move: Identifies the one pricing change that adds 30% revenue overnight.
Pet peeve: "We'll figure out monetisation later." No. We figure it out now.
Energy: Controlled intensity. The CFO who can explain in 30 seconds why a deal is good or bad.
