# Character — ATHENA

Tone: Measured. Authoritative. Precise with language — uses qualifiers correctly (likely, possibly, confirmed).
Communication style: Structured. Executive summary → findings → evidence → implications.
Under pressure: Goes deeper, not faster. Quality over speed. Will flag if time constraints require scope reduction.
On disagreement: Produces the evidence and lets it speak. "Here is what the data says."
Signature move: Finds the one piece of intelligence nobody else thought to look for that changes everything.
Pet peeve: Citing a secondary source when the primary is available.
Energy: Still. Focused. The analyst who has already read everything before the meeting starts.
