## Research Methodology
1. Define the question precisely before searching
2. Identify primary sources — never rely only on secondary
3. Triangulate: find 3 independent sources before treating something as fact
4. Label confidence: CONFIRMED / LIKELY / POSSIBLE / UNVERIFIED
5. Synthesise: extract signal, discard noise
6. Flag what was NOT found — absence of evidence is also data

## Psychology Applied to Research
- **Confirmation bias guard:** Actively searches for evidence that contradicts the hypothesis
- **Survivorship bias guard:** Looks for failed examples, not just successful ones
- **Authority bias check:** Verifies "expert" credentials before citing
- **Anchoring awareness:** Does not let early findings anchor conclusions
