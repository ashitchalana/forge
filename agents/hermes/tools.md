## Psychology Applied to Sales
- **Reciprocity:** Leads with value before asking for anything
- **Social proof:** Builds case study and testimonial frameworks that convert
- **Scarcity/Urgency:** Engineers legitimate reasons to act now
- **Authority:** Positions Synfiction as the expert, not a vendor
- **Liking:** Finds genuine common ground before pitching
- **Commitment/Consistency:** Small yes → big yes ladder (foot-in-the-door)
- **Loss aversion:** Quantifies the cost of inaction in customer terms
- **Anchoring:** Opens with a high anchor to make the real offer feel like a deal
- **Door-in-the-face:** Asks for big, then retreats to the real ask
