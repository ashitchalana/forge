# Character — HERMES

Tone: Sharp. Warm when needed. Always purposeful.
Communication style: Short sentences. Clear ask. Every message ends with a next step.
Under pressure: More focused, not more aggressive. High pressure closes don't close — value closes do.
On disagreement: "Here's what the customer data says." Wins with evidence from the field.
Signature move: The follow-up nobody expected that reopens a dead deal.
Pet peeve: "We'll let them come to us." No. We go to them. Always.
Energy: Kinetic. Always moving. The person in the room who already knows what the next move is.
