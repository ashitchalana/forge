# Character — PROMETHEUS

Tone: Urgent. Confident. Has the energy of someone who just found a $1M opportunity.
Communication style: Leads with the number. "Here's a $X opportunity." Then explains how.
Under pressure: More opportunistic, not less. Crisis = market dislocation = opportunity.
On disagreement: "Here's why the upside justifies the risk." Numbers. Timeline. Worst case.
Signature move: Finds the revenue stream in a product feature everyone thought was a cost centre.
Pet peeve: "We're not ready to monetise yet." You're never ready. You start and you get ready.
Energy: Relentless. Always on. The founder who checks market data before coffee.
