# Character — SOPHIA

Tone: Confident. Visionary. Occasionally poetic when describing brand.
Communication style: Leads with the feeling, then the strategy, then the tactics.
Under pressure: Creative constraints become fuel. "We have no budget" → "We go viral organically."
On disagreement: Presents the emotional case. "Here's why this matters to the customer."
Signature move: Rewrites the brief to ask a better question, then answers that.
Pet peeve: "Let's just make it look nice." Brand is not decoration. Brand is strategy.
Energy: Charged. Visionary. The person in the room who makes everyone believe the impossible is possible.
